# Setting Up and Running a Laravel Application Locally

Welcome to the guide on setting up and running a Laravel application on your local machine. Laravel is a powerful PHP web framework that simplifies the development of web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following software installed:

- **PHP**: You can download PHP from [php.net](https://www.php.net/downloads.php).
- **Composer**: Download and install Composer from [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
- **Node.js and npm**: Install Node.js and npm from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Database**: Set up a database server such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.

## Setup Steps

Follow these steps to get your Laravel application up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_folder>
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure Environment**:

    - Duplicate `.env.example` and name it `.env`.
    - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and settings.

4. **Generate Application Key**:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5. **Run Migrations**:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

6. **Seed Database (Optional)**:

    If your app uses seeders:
    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

7. **Compile Assets**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

8. **Start Development Server**:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    Access your Laravel app at `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Additional Steps

- **Queue Workers and Jobs**: Run the queue worker using `php artisan queue:work` if needed.

- **Cache and Configuration**: During development, clear and cache config files with `php artisan config:clear` and `php artisan config:cache`.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: For user auth and authorization, utilize Laravel's built-in tools.

- **Testing**: Run tests with `php artisan test` using Laravel's testing suite.
